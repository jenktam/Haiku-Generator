I built a Haiku Generator that prints out haikus in the command line. In short, a haiku is a poem that writes 5 syllables on the first line, 7 on the second, and 5 on the third.

This project uses Node.js, Javascript, and data from a file called CMUDictm, which contains thousands of English words and the phoneme of how they are pronounced.
