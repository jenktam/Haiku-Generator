# Haiku Generator

A haiku is a type of poem that writes 5 syllables on the first line, 7 on the second, and 5 on the third. I built a Haiku Generator that prints out haikus in the command line. It also has a responsive design.

The magic from this project comes from Node.js, Javascript, HTML, CSS, and data from a file called CMUDict. CMUDict contains thousands of English words and the phoneme of how they are pronounced.
